## Projects
Let's take a look at my current projects:

## 1. Tuktuk (Autorickshaw) Detection

# Tuktuk (Auto-rickshaw) Detection using YOLOv8 and IDD Dataset

A deep learning project to detect auto-rickshaws (tuk-tuks) using YOLOv8 and the India Driving Dataset (IDD). The pretrained model is optimized for Indian subcontinental traffic conditions and can handle various lighting conditions, occlusions, and complex traffic scenarios. The repository also provides easy processing of the dataset into YOLO format, to train your own model very easily.

## 2. Three Sphears

# A 3D interactive experience using Unity 3D

This Unity project showcases an interactive 3D experience where users can interact with three spheres which are rotating around each other. After starting from the starting screen, upon clicking any sphere, the camera smoothly zooms in on the selected sphere, transitioning to another scene which gives more information on the selected sphere, with a restart button on screen to start the scenes again. This project demonstrates advanced Unity features such as camera control, object interactions, and scene transitions.
